05:12:19 You: Hi there Wendy.  My name's Ed.  I'm working for Ben, the adviser.
05:13:04 You: Got a question for you.  We're starting a new BT Super account for a client, and rolling in their balance from another fund.  The client will then make a $50k non-concessional contribution and roll the lot into a BT pension.
05:13:05 Wendy: Hi Ed
05:13:31 You: We're sending the client an email setting out the steps from their end.  It's our first BT super account so I want to make sure we get it right.
05:14:14 You: Am I correct in saying that we can set the account up, lodge the rollover request, and lodge the direct debit request, and the client will just need to authorise from their end?  And they'll get an email asking them to do this?
05:14:34 Wendy: Ok, Ed can I just clarify that the only reason you are setting up a super account instead of a pension is to do a rollover and a contribution before then moving it into a pension?
05:14:55 You: That's it.  Just holding off so he can make the contribution.
05:15:50 Wendy: Yes when you set the account up, the client will get an email asking them to approve the application online. The client then also needs to verify the linked account to allow you to request deposits from it. After this you can request rollovers and contributions via the desktop.
05:16:21 Wendy: Ok in that case, you can set the account up as a Pension account as this will first sit in accumulation phase to allow you to request rollovers and contributions.
05:17:10 Wendy: Once everything has been received and you are happy to commute the pension, there is a button on the desktop for you to hit Commence Pension and we will commute it.
05:17:25 You: Oh right.  That's great.  Ok.
05:17:50 You: So there's kind of a super account behind the scenes but you guys handle it so we don't have to bother setting up a wash-through account then commuting to pension
05:18:26 Wendy: Yep, that's right.
05:19:34 You: Last question: for setting up the binding nominations for the account, when we lodge it through the platform, will the client get an email with an attachment to sign and return?  Does BT require an original signed hard copy?
05:21:01 Wendy: The client only gets an email notifying them that the beneficiary details have been changed but no forms are required and we do not require them to sign in and approve. 
05:21:24 You: Ok great.  Thanks
05:21:41 You: Just checking - that goes for binding non-lapsing nominations as well?
05:24:09 Wendy: We offer non-lapsing nominations but not binding in the traditional sense, but yes that applies for all types of nominations on Panorama.
05:24:31 You: I see.  So still at the trustee's discretion.
05:25:48 Wendy: That's right
05:26:20 You: Ok.  That's me out of questions.  Thanks for your help Wendy.
05:27:32 Wendy: Your welcome. Thanks for using the chats Ed and have a nice weekend.
05:27:34 info: The chat session has been closed by your BT Panorama representative.
